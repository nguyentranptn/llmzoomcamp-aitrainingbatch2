        "# Semantic Chunking for Document Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This code implements a semantic chunking approach for processing and retrieving information from PDF documents, [first proposed by Greg Kamradt](https://youtu.be/8OJC21T2SL4?t=1933) and subsequently [implemented in LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/semantic-chunker/). Unlike traditional methods that split text based on fixed character or word counts, semantic chunking aims to create more meaningful and context-aware text segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional text splitting methods often break documents at arbitrary points, potentially disrupting the flow of information and context. Semantic chunking addresses this issue by attempting to split text at more natural breakpoints, preserving semantic coherence within each chunk.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. PDF processing and text extraction\n",
        "2. Semantic chunking using LangChain's SemanticChunker\n",
        "3. Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings\n",
        "4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "### Document Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The PDF is read and converted to a string using a custom `read_pdf_to_string` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Semantic Chunking\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Utilizes LangChain's `SemanticChunker` with OpenAI embeddings.\n",
        "2. Three breakpoint types are available:\n",
        "   - 'percentile': Splits at differences greater than the X percentile.\n",
        "   - 'standard_deviation': Splits at differences greater than X standard deviations.\n",
        "   - 'interquartile': Uses the interquartile distance to determine split points.\n",
        "3. In this implementation, the 'percentile' method is used with a threshold of 90.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vector Store Creation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the semantic chunks.\n",
        "2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retriever Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Context-Aware Splitting: Attempts to maintain semantic coherence within chunks.\n",
        "2. Flexible Configuration: Allows for different breakpoint types and thresholds.\n",
        "3. Integration with Advanced NLP Tools: Uses OpenAI embeddings for both chunking and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved Coherence: Chunks are more likely to contain complete thoughts or ideas.\n",
        "2. Better Retrieval Relevance: By preserving context, retrieval accuracy may be enhanced.\n",
        "3. Adaptability: The chunking method can be adjusted based on the nature of the documents and retrieval needs.\n",
        "4. Potential for Better Understanding: LLMs or downstream tasks may perform better with more coherent text segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Details\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Uses OpenAI's embeddings for both the semantic chunking process and the final vector representations.\n",
        "2. Employs FAISS for creating an efficient searchable index of the chunks.\n",
        "3. The retriever is set up to return the top 2 most relevant chunks, which can be adjusted as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "The code includes a test query: \"What is the main cause of climate change?\". This demonstrates how the semantic chunking and retrieval system can be used to find relevant information from the processed document.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Semantic chunking represents an advanced approach to document processing for retrieval systems. By attempting to maintain semantic coherence within text segments, it has the potential to improve the quality of retrieved information and enhance the performance of downstream NLP tasks. This technique is particularly valuable for processing long, complex documents where maintaining context is crucial, such as scientific papers, legal documents, or comprehensive reports."

              "'Understanding Climate Change \\nChapter 1: Introduction to Climate Change \\nClimate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past century, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change. \\nHistorical Context \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization. \\nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes. \\nModern Observations \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \\nGreenhouse Gases \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. \\nFossil Fuels \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday. \\nCoal \\nCoal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and its use for electricity generation is a major \\nsource of CO2 emissions. Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \\nenergy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China, India, and the United \\nStates, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints. \\nOil \\nOil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \\noil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \\nchange and air quality issues. The global oil industry is vast, involving extraction, refining, \\nand distribution, with significant geopolitical and economic implications. \\nNatural Gas \\nNatural gas is the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \\nlower-carbon future. However, its extraction and use still contribute to greenhouse gas \\nemissions, particularly methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas.

The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past century, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change. Historical Context \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes. Modern Observations \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \\nGreenhouse Gases \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. Fossil Fuels \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday. Coal \\nCoal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and its use for electricity generation is a major \\nsource of CO2 emissions. Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \\nenergy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China, India, and the United \\nStates, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints. Oil \\nOil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \\noil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \\nchange and air quality issues.'),\n",

This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more \\nsignificant increases than others. Heatwaves \\nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture, \\nand infrastructure. Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. Heatwaves can lead to heat-related illnesses and exacerbate existing health conditions. Changing Seasons \\nClimate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human \\nactivities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and \\nmilder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles and agricultural \\npractices. Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels \\nWarmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \\nsea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \\nthreatening coastal communities and ecosystems. Polar Ice Melt \\nThe Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \\nloss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \\naffects global ocean currents and weather patterns. Glacial Retreat \\nGlaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. Regions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \\nparticular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture. Coastal Erosion \\nRising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \\nhomes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low-lying islands and coastal regions are especially \\nvulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like sea walls and \\nmanaged retreats. Extreme Weather Events \\nClimate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \\nevents, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \\ndevastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems. Hurricanes and Typhoons \\nWarmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \\ndestructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \\nwarning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these risks. Droughts \\nIncreased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent \\nand severe droughts. This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \\narid and semi-arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shortages and exacerbate \\nconflicts. Flooding \\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding. Urban \\nareas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk. Flood management \\nstrategies include improved drainage systems, green infrastructure, and floodplain restoration. Ocean Acidification \\nIncreased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans. This causes the water to become more acidic, which can harm marine life, particularly \\norganisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some shellfish. Coral Reefs \\nCoral reefs are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and acidity. Ocean acidification \\nand warming waters contribute to coral bleaching and mortality, threatening biodiversity and \\nfisheries. Protecting and restoring coral reefs is essential for marine conservation. Marine Ecosystems \\nAcidification affects the health and survival of various marine species, disrupting food webs \\nand ecosystems. This has implications for commercial fisheries and the livelihoods of people \\nwho depend on the ocean.'),\n",
